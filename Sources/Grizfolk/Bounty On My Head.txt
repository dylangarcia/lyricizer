          
            [Verse 1]
I've been waiting for so long
Would you believe me when I said
I've been a fool without your heart?
I must've been misled
[Pre-Chorus]
Would you love me when I'm gone?
Would you love me when I'm dead?
Would you love me with a bounty on my head?
A bounty on my head?
[Chorus]
I've got a really bad feeling I'm gonna love you so good
Take you down to my hometown, my old neighborhood
I've got a really bad feeling you're gonna hurt me so good
I'll go down any way you want, any way I should
[Verse 2]
No dream comes true
Until you're left hanging by a thread
Until all hope fades away
And blue has turned to red
[Pre-Chorus]
Would you love me when I'm gone?
Would you love me when I'm dead?
Would you love me with a bounty on my head?
A bounty on my head?
[Chorus]
I've got a really bad feeling I'm gonna love you so good
Take you down to my hometown, my old neighborhood
I've got a really bad feeling you're gonna hurt me so good
I'll go down any way you want, any way I should
[Bridge]
Alone is what we are
If we are not bleeding
Are we bleeding now? Oh
Alone is what we are
If we are not bleeding
Are we bleeding now?
[Chorus]
I've got a really bad feeling I'm gonna love you so good
Take you down to my hometown, my old neighborhood
I've got a really bad feeling you're gonna hurt me so good
I'll go down any way you want, any way I should
