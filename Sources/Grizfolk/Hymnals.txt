          
            We're high and dry from the spark
So we hide and lie and we hope to lose control
And we don't know what we're waiting for
And we don't know the truth anymore
And we can't see clearly through the fog
And we'll end up chasing ghosts
Well, outside these walls we're criminals
They chase us down, we're singing hymnals
We tried so hard to cope
We fell so many times, we learned to climb without a rope
And we don't know what we're waiting for
And we don't know the truth anymore
And we can't see clearly through the fog
And we'll end up chasing ghosts
Outside these walls we're criminals
They chase us down, we're singing hymnals
If somebody told me this was a calling I wouldn't hang it up to dry
If somebody told me I shouldn't be stalling I wouldn't feed the world a lie
Well, outside these walls we're criminals
And they chase us down, we're singing hymnals
