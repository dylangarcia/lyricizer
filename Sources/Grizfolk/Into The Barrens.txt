          
            [Verse 1]
You say mysterious
Well, I say I'm just a lonely wolf wandering
A bit delirious
When all the trees appear the same, appear the same
[Chorus]
Cast me away, my shadow's cold
Into the barrens where I will grow old
Well, I'm not looking for answers
And I'm not looking for gold
[Verse 2]
The voices in my head
They echo in the wind and I begin to sway
I follow what they say
I can't see their eyes, but I hear howling through the haze
[Chorus]
Cast me away, my shadow's cold
Into the barrens where I will grow old
Well, I'm not looking for answers
And I'm not looking for gold
Gold, gold
[Chorus]
Cast me away, my shadow's cold
Into the barrens where I will grow old
Cast me away, my shadow's cold
Into the barrens where I will grow old
Well, I'm not looking for answers
And I'm not looking for gold
Well, I'm not looking for answers
And I'm not looking for gold
