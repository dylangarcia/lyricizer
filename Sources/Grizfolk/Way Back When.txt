          
            [Verse 1]
There's always time for living
Can we just do it again?
One more time like it once was...
Way back when
You gave me something to believe in
We were the best of friends
Well I remember the good times...
Way back when, when
[Chorus]
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
Memories will fade if you wanted me to let you go
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
I've got you on your way
I'll be there for you don't you know?
[Verse 2]
We're superheroes and villains
When we used to pretend
We go wherever our minds will take us...
Way back when
[Chorus]
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
Memories will fade if you wanted me to let you go
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
I've got you on your way
I'll be there for you don't you know?
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
I know we'll be okay
This luck we have it cannot go
Ahhhhoo, Ahhhhoo
And you're on own
Ahhhhoo, Ahhhhoo
You're not alone
Ahhhhoo, Ahhhhoo
I know i'll see you again, again
Ahhhhoo, Ahhhhoo
And if all these things
Ahhhhoo, Ahhhhoo
Come to an end
Ahhhhoo, Ahhhhoo
We'll always have... A Way Back When
[Chorus]
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
Memories will fade if you wanted me to let you go
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
I've got you on your way
I' ll be there for you don't you know?
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid
(La, la, lala, la, lala, la, la)
I know we'll be okay
This luck we have it cannot go
