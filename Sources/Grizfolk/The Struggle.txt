          
            [Verse 1]
Brothers got room to talk
Messin’ round on the block
Corner shops, stares, and stops
Mother would rather not
[Pre-Chorus]
You’re young enough to say what you feel
So say what you feel, say what you feel
Sometimes it’s all that we got
It’s all that we got, it’s all that we got then it’s gone
[Chorus]
He turns around and sees the world he knows fall apart
The struggle you are up against makes you what you are
[Verse 2]
Sneakin’ round through the cracks
Doubling up the stacks
He said if God lives by the gun
I’ll show the world a little more love
[Pre-Chorus]
You’re young enough to say what you feel
So say what you feel, say what you feel
Sometimes it’s all that we got
All that we got, it’s all that we got then it’s gone
[Chorus]
He turns around and sees the world he knows fall apart
The struggle you are up against makes you what you are
Don’t turn around when you’re alone running in the dark
The struggle you are up against makes you what you are
[Chorus]
He turns around and sees the world he knows fall apart
The struggle you are up against makes you what you are
Don’t turn around when you’re alone running in the dark
The struggle you are up against makes you what you are
