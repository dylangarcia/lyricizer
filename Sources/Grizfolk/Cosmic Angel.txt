          
            [Verse 1]
She's my garden, I'm her love
Celestial body from above
I throw a diamond in a well
Forget all that I know
Cause I just wanna live inside your eyes
In between a million different stars
Underneath the feeling of it all
Outside the garden of your thoughts
[Chorus]
Falling this far
And still confused as to what you are
If Heaven is your heart
This hell I've been living in is so dark
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm her muse and she's my queen
And she's the serpent of the sea
She makes waves, we know them well
And I'll be drowning when they go
Well, I just wanna live inside your eyes
In between a million different stars
Underneath the feeling of it all
Outside the garden of your thoughts
[Chorus]
Falling this far
And still confused as to what you are
If Heaven is your heart
This hell I've been living in is so dark
So dark, so dark
So dark, so dark
[Chorus]
Falling this far
And still confused as to what you are
If Heaven is your heart
This hell I've been living in is so dark
So dark, so dark
So dark, so dark
