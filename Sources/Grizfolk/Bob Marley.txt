          
            [Verse 1]
Something 'bout the way the highway meets my eyes in twos
Tell me everything you know; tell me something new
I wanna drive your El Dorado straight into the sun
You're the shotgun by my side, horizon in your eyes
[Chorus]
I hear Bob Marley's playing on the radio
Well, Bob Marley's playing on the radio
I wanna move in close; girl, don't you tell me no
Bob Marley's playing on the radio
[Verse 2]
Can I choose to feel this way for the rest of my days?
This is a great unknown; open road is my home
With your top down, we'll find the gateway to the stars
Into the great unknown; Mama's a rolling stone
[Chorus]
This could be love cause Bob Marley's playing on the radio
Well, Bob Marley's playing on the radio
I wanna move in close; girl, don't you tell me no
Bob Marley's playing on the radio
[Chorus]
I feel the love cause Bob Marley's playing on the radio
Bob Marley's playing on the radio
I wanna move in close; girl, don't you tell me no
Bob Marley's playing on the radio
