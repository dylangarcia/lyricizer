          
            [Verse 1]
Running from shelter
You're my bohemian bird
The winter has melted
And summer won't be left unheard
We've been lost before
We'll be lost forever
And they can keep asking
And we'll tell them we're displaced together
[Verse 2]
Raindrops like roadblocks
We're the indigenous ones
We scraped out the bottom
And we drift in the morning sun
We can live our lives
Like the colors in our feathers
They can keep asking
We'll tell them we're displaced together
[Verse 3]
And nothing is broken and nothing is lost
We'll hear the unspoken, the bridges we cross
And I'll remain fearless at trails that don't last
The trees become ghosts and the journey's at bay
And nothing is broken and nothing is lost
We'll hear the unspoken, the bridges we cross
And I'll remain fearless at trails that don't last
The trees become ghosts and the journey's at bay
