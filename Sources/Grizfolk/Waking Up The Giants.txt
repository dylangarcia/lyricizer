          
            [Verse 1]
Be careful waking up the giants
He's a bigger man and a better man than I am
We rise up when we hear the sirens
Where's the truth when your heart's not lying
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been living like the end's not dying
I only listen to the wind when it's crying
[Chorus]
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that's been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
[Verse 2]
Sail away, the water's rising
Leaving all regrets behind us
Right before we fail, we'll find it
Right behind the storm it was hiding
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been living like the end's not dying
I only listen to the wind when it's crying
[Chorus]
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that's been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that's been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
[Bridge]
Waking up the giants
Waking up the giants
Waking, waking, waking up the giants
Waking, waking, waking up the giants
[Chorus]
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that's been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that's been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
[Outro]
Waking, waking, waking up the giants
Waking, waking, waking up the giants
