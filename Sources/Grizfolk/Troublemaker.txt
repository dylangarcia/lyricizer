          
            [Verse 1]
If I could love you in the right way
I wouldn't let you down before I go
I woke up in a black haze
Tomorrow I'll be plowing through the snow
[Pre-Chorus]
Your heart is strong, yeah, your back is made of gold
These lies don't work and these ties are getting old
[Chorus]
Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor
Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker
You're my troublemaker
You're my troublemaker
[Verse 2]
I'll chase you for a lifetime
If you leave me with a thrill I can't contain
With emptiness by my side
I'll always have a place to hide the pain
[Pre-Chorus]
Your heart is strong, yeah, your back is made of gold
These lies don't work and these ties are getting old
[Chorus]
Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor
Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker
You're my troublemaker
You're my troublemaker
[Bridge]
The trouble in you is the trouble in me
The trouble in you is the trouble in me
I know it's trouble, I love it; if you give it, I take it
Cause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker
[Chorus]
Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor
Gonna put you in my pocket and save you for later
Cause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker
Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor
Gonna put you in my pocket and save you for later
Cause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker
