          
            She's my guide and I'm her love
Celestial body from above
I throw a diamond in a well
Forget all that I know
'Cause I just 'wanna live inside your eyes
In between a million different stars
Underneath the feelin' of it all
Outside the garden of your thoughts
The fault in this fall
Is still confused as to what you are
Heaven is your heart
This hell I've been livin' in is so dark
So dark
So dark
So dark
So dark
She's my guide and I'm her love
Celestial body from above
I throw a diamond in a well
Forget all that I know
'Cause I just wanna live inside your eyes
In between a million different stars
Underneath the feelin' of it all
Outside the garden of your thoughts
The fault in this fall
Is still confused as to what you are
Heaven is your heart
This hell I've been livin' in is so dark
So dark
So dark
So dark
So dark
The fault in this fall
Is still confused as to what you are
Heaven is your heart
This hell I've been livin' in is so dark
So dark
So dark
So dark
So dark
